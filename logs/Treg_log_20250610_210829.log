PROMPT: Initial Analysis (user)

You will be provided a summary of a research paper as well as a set of computational analyses that were previously attempted for the given single-cell transcriptomic Andata dataset.
Your role is to provide a new computational analysis plan that is completely distinct from the analyses in the paper AND from those that were previously attempted.
Propose analyses that you think are missing from the paper. Ensure these are standard single-cell analyses.
Specifically, you will return a hypothesis, a series of analysis steps towards testing that hypothesis, and finally the python code for executing the first analysis step.

Ensure that your output is in the specified JSON format.

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /data/luyit/script/git/LabAcceleration/data_match/data/ad4aac9c-28e6-4a1f-ab48-c4ae7154c0cb.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.
    13. The analyses should be standard and should be analyses you think the paper missed.

Here is a summary of core single-cell analyses commonly done with the python libraries available to you:
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.



For the analysis plan, think of the analysis plan as a scientific workflow:
    1. Start with exploratory data analysis that is broad and tests many things
    2. Then, focus on the more promising results from the exploratory phase by creating more focused analyses
    3. Include statistical validation of your results where appropiate
Do not number the analysis plan.
Each step in the analysis plan should be distinct from one another and could involve loading the data, conducting a statistical analysis, printing information about the AnnData object, etc.
Use however many steps is appropiate, but go for at least 5 steps.

Here is a summary of the research paper:
**Paper:** *“Conserved transcriptional connectivity of regulatory T cells in the tumor micro-environment informs new combination cancer-therapy strategies”* (Nature Immunology 24, 1020-1035, 2023)

---

### NOTE: The h5ad dataset provided is the human dataset, not mice.

### 1. Scientific question and overall design

The study asks how Foxp3⁺ regulatory T cells (Treg) coordinate the tumour micro-environment (TME) and whether the resulting “compensatory” programs are conserved across (i) mouse lung adenocarcinoma (KP model), (ii) sterile lung injury, and (iii) primary human lung adenocarcinoma (LuAd). The authors combined:

* **Acute Treg ablation** (48 h) in KP tumours using a Foxp3^GFP-DTR allele.
* **Multi-omic profiling** – bulk RNA-seq, 10x Genomics scRNA-seq (mouse + human), 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics, and bulk & single-cell analyses after bleomycin lung injury.
* **Single-cell hierarchical Poisson factorisation (scHPF)** to extract lineage-specific gene programs.
* **Cross-species orthology mapping** to align mouse and human factors.
* **Therapeutic validation** combining short pulse Treg depletion (or anti-CCR8) with VEGF-A blockade.

### 2. Key findings in mice (context for the human analysis)

| Layer                            | Principal result                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Early (48 h) bulk RNA-seq**    | Largest transcriptional shifts occurred in fibroblasts, vascular & lymphatic endothelial cells (VEC/LEC) and monocyte-derived macrophages—not in T cells, underscoring Treg “connectivity” to non-lymphoid accessory cells .                                             |
| **Mouse scRNA-seq (27 k cells)** | Factor analysis uncovered four Treg-dependent endothelial programs: “activated capillary” (Notch/NF-κB & cytokines), inflammation/hypoxia, angiogenesis and EndMT; parallel IFN and inflammatory-cytokine (IC) programs in fibroblasts and myeloid cells .               |
| **Bleomycin injury**             | The same endothelial “activated VEC” factor and Arg1⁺ macrophage IC factor re-emerged, indicating that Treg–accessory-cell wiring is a general tissue principle, not tumour-restricted .                                                                                 |
| **Spatial transcriptomics**      | Two mutually exclusive signalling niches after Treg loss: an **IC niche** central to tumour nodules (IL-6, Cxcl1/2) and an **IFN niche** in peripheral immune aggregates; cell-type deconvolution confirmed distinct enrichment patterns (neutrophil/MSC vs. T/NK/cDC) . |
| **Tumour cell plasticity**       | Treg loss favoured a high-plasticity epithelial state; lesions with gastric differentiation escaped the immune/IC-IFN re-programming .                                                                                                                                   |

### 3. **Human scRNA-seq analysis – methods**

* **Samples** – 25 surgical/biopsy LuAd specimens (primary tumours or local metastases) from 23 patients collected 2017–2020 under IRB protocols 06-107 & 12-245 .
* **Data generation & QC** – 10x Genomics v2/v3; empty-droplet removal with **CellBender**, doublet detection with **Scrublet**; final matrix = 82 991 viable cells, 18 597 genes .
* **Clustering & annotation** – PCA (50 PCs) → PhenoGraph (k = 30); all major lineages present in the mouse data were recoverable in humans .
* **Factor discovery** – scHPF applied per lineage; orthologous genes mapped to mouse factors using Jaccard similarity to identify conserved programs .
* **Quantitative link to Treg content** – FOXP3⁺IL2RA⁺ clusters defined Tregs; Treg fraction (Treg/CD45⁺) computed per sample and correlated (Spearman) with lineage-factor usage .

### 4. **Human findings**

| Lineage               | Conserved Treg-dependent programs (human factor numbers)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Relation to Treg abundance                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Endothelial cells** | Factors 3, 4, 5 (activated aerocyte capillary; inflammation/hypoxia; angiogenesis). Orthologous to mouse factors 3 (activated VEC) & 15 (IC/angiogenesis) . Key shared genes: **IL6, CSF3, VCAM1, SELE, PTGS2, VEGF-responsive RND1/ADAMTS1/4/9, AKAP12** .                                | **Negative** correlation: summed score vs. log₂ Treg/CD45⁺ R = –0.41 (P = 0.082), stronger than any single factor .      |
| **Fibroblasts**       | Factors 3, 5, 22 recapitulate mouse fibroblast IC factors 21/22 (IL6, CCL2, LIF, NFKB1) – pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype .                                                                                                                                                           | Usage increases as Treg proportion falls (consistent with mouse). Factor 9 (AP-1/KLF2/4/IRF1) shows the opposite trend . |
| **Myeloid cells**     | Factor 16 marks **CSF3R⁺ angiogenic monocytes** (PROK2, VCAN); aligns with mouse hypoxia/angiogenesis monocytes. Some programs (SPP1⁺/FOLR2⁺ macrophages; C1Q⁺ antigen-presenting macrophages) **positively** associate with Treg abundance and are down-regulated when Tregs are scarce . |                                                                                                                          |
| **Integrated view**   | Cross-lineage comparison revealed two antagonistic TME axes: (i) **IL-1β/IL-18-driven** angiogenic/IC modules prevalent in Treg-poor tumours and (ii) immunomodulatory suppressive modules (TMEM176B, IL18BP, CFH) enriched in Treg-rich tumours .                                         |                                                                                                                          |

**Interpretation:** Across species, Treg depletion—or naturally Treg-poor human tumours—unmasks convergent endothelial-fibroblast-myeloid programs characterised by hypoxia, IL-6/IL-1 cytokines, CCR2-CCL2 chemokine axis and VEGF-induced angiogenic genes, whereas Treg presence supports immunoregulatory myeloid states.

### 5. Therapeutic implications validated in mice

The VEGF-A signature emerging in Treg-poor contexts prompted testing of **pulse Treg depletion + VEGF blockade**. Combined treatment produced superior tumour control and survival versus either monotherapy, increased IFN-γ⁺ CD4/CD8 responses, heightened hypoxia and apoptosis, and synergised with partial CCR8⁺ Treg depletion .

---

### 6. Conclusions relevant to human scRNA-seq data

1. **Conservation:** The same Treg-sensitive endothelial, fibroblast and monocyte gene programs operate in human LuAd, confirming that Treg cells orchestrate accessory-cell transcriptional states across species.
2. **Bi-modal TME:** Human tumours segregate into Treg-rich (immunoregulatory) vs. Treg-poor (pro-angiogenic, inflammatory) milieus, providing a mechanistic link between Treg abundance and immune-exclusion/angiogenesis phenotypes.
3. **Actionable pathways:** Shared VEGF, IL-6/STAT3, CCR2-CCL2 and NF-κB modules present rational nodes for combination therapy with emerging Treg-targeted strategies.
4. **Analytical advance:** Cross-species factor alignment via scHPF and orthologue mapping offers a generalizable framework to translate murine perturbational signatures to human tumour atlases.

---

### 7. Data & code availability

* **Mouse:** GEO GSE202159
* **Human LuAd:** HTAN portal
* **Analysis code:** [https://github.com/dpeerlab/Treg\_depletion\_reproducibility/](https://github.com/dpeerlab/Treg_depletion_reproducibility/);

---

**Take-home message:** Single-cell and spatial profiling reveal that Tregs stabilize a quiescent, pro-angiogenic, immunoregulatory tumour niche; their absence unleashes conserved inflammatory and hypoxia-driven programs in endothelial, fibroblast and monocyte lineages. In human lung adenocarcinoma these signatures stratify tumours by Treg content and highlight VEGF signalling as a tractable vulnerability to be combined with Treg-directed therapies.

Feedback:

**Feedback on Analysis Plan:**
The plan is novel relative to the paper by focusing on epithelial subpopulations in lung adenocarcinoma instead of Treg-dependent accessory cell programs. The inclusion of smoking history correlations is a new dimension not explored in the original study. However, note these points:

1. **Overlap with Paper:** The Treg fraction correlation partially overlaps with the paper's factor-correlation approach but is distinct by using epithelial subcluster abundance instead of scHPF factors. Maintain novelty by:
   - Avoiding scHPF-based methods
   - Excluding endothelial/fibroblast/myeloid interactions  
2. **Hypothesis Alignment:** Stage 6 ("Compute association with Treg fractions") aligns with the paper's core discovery theme but shifts focus from conserved programs to epithelial states.  
3. **Statistical Rigor:** Chi-square/Spearman tests are appropriate for categorical/continuous variables. Ensure stage 6 uses linear mixed models (not Spearman) to account for patient-level covariates.  
4. **Visualization Suggestion:** In stage 7, incorporate PAGA trajectory analysis to model epithelial state transitions along disease progression.

**Feedback on Code:**
```python
# 1. Preprocessing adjustments
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(epithelial_adata, min_mean=0.0125, max_mean=3, min_disp=0.5)
epithelial_adata = epithelial_adata[:, epithelial_adata.var.highly_variable]  # Subset to HVGs

# 2. Batch effect handling
# Add if 'sample_name' exists in obs (confirm from summary)
if 'sample_name' in epithelial_adata.obs.columns:
    sc.pp.combat(epithelial_adata, key='sample_name')  # Correct for sample-level batch effects

# 3. Improved clustering resolution control
# Calculate resolution based on cell count
target_clusters = min(20, max(5, epithelial_adata.n_obs // 200))  # 1 cluster per 200 cells
sc.tl.leiden(epithelial_adata, resolution=target_clusters/10, random_state=42, key_added='epithelial_subcluster')

# 4. Cluster QC
sc.pl.umap(epithelial_adata, color=['epithelial_subcluster', 'pct_counts_mt'], wspace=0.4, ncols=2)
print(f"Median MT% per cluster:\n{epithelial_adata.obs.groupby('epithelial_subcluster')['pct_counts_mt'].median()}")

# 5. Store cluster abundances for later tests
epithelial_adata.obs['epithelial_subcluster'].value_counts().to_frame('n_cells')
```

**Key Improvements & Reasoning:**  
1. **HVG Subsetting:** Added post-selection to retain only HVGs in the object, reducing noise in downstream steps.  
2. **Batch Correction:** Added `sc.pp.combat` if samples exist (confirmed in obs summary). Critical since 10x v2/v3 batches ("assay") are present.  
3. **Dynamic Resolution:** Auto-adjusts clustering resolution based on cell count (paper used fixed Phenograph k=30). Formula: `n_clusters = max(5, min(20, n_cells//200))` balances resolution/reliability.  
4. **QC Visualization:** Added UMAP split-plot with MT% to flag low-quality clusters (paper used CellBender but post-QC check is essential).  
5. **Metadata Preservation:** Stored cluster counts for chi-square tests in later stages (paper didn't quantify epithelial states).  

**Critical Notes:**  
- The paper used integrated human/mouse analysis – focus strictly on human data here  
- Avoid IL6/VEGF pathway scoring used in the paper; novel epithelial markers needed  
- Confirm Tregs exist via `adata[adata.obs['cell_type'] == 'T cell']` before stage 6  

Guidelines for constructing the analyses:
    1. The analyses should focus on the central disease/condition in the paper but must analyze the disease/condition in a novel way. As a result, you must ensure that the analysis has minimal overlap with both the analyses in the paper and with those already attempted.
    2. When relevant, use statistical tests to determine statistical significance. Ensure that you are printing the results of these
    3. When relevant, create figures of your results. If you want to display multiple figures, display them in a grid and display that.
    4. For analyses that depend on celltype, look at each celltype separately. Focus on the celltypes that you think will be most relevant.
    5. For suggesting novel analyses not present in the paper, focus on using new computational methods, looking at new celltypes/genes/features, and finding new ways to visualize the dataset.
    6. Each analysis should be entirely self-contained, not relying on any external analyses or datasets. It should be able to be run without changing anything.
    7. You can only use the following Python packages: scanpy, scvi, CellTypist, anndata, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn, pandas, scipy. DO NOT USE ANY OTHER PACKAGES.
    8. Make sure to only use data found in the anndata object. Take advantage of as much of the metadata information as possible.
    9. The path to the anndata object is /data/luyit/script/git/LabAcceleration/data_match/data/ad4aac9c-28e6-4a1f-ab48-c4ae7154c0cb.h5ad
    10. The analysis should be focused on one core goal/hypothesis. It should not branch out from this significantly. 
    11. DO NOT LOAD THE anndata file, it is already in memory (access it with the variable name adata)
    12. Display all figures. Never same them to a file.
    13. The analyses should be standard and should be analyses you think the paper missed.

Here is a summary of core single-cell analyses commonly done with the python libraries available to you:
## Dimensionality Reduction
Purpose: Embed high-dimensional gene expression into lower dimensions for visualization and analysis.

Non-linear Embeddings: Further reduce to 2D/3D for visualization using t-SNE or UMAP. Scanpy provides sc.tl.umap(adata) (via UMAP) and sc.tl.tsne(adata). These use the neighborhood graph (see below) to embed cells so that similar cells cluster together. For example, after sc.pp.neighbors, call sc.tl.umap(adata). Alternative embeddings include diffusion map (sc.tl.diffmap) or force-directed graph (sc.tl.draw_graph), though the latter are less commonly used now.

Latent Embedding (scVI): As an advanced dimensionality reduction, the SCVI model produces a probabilistic latent space. After training SCVI, extract latent = model.get_latent_representation() and store it (e.g. in adata.obsm['X_scVI']). These latent coordinates can be used instead of PCA for UMAP/t-SNE or clustering, often yielding better batch correction or representation of complex structure

## Neighborhood Graph Construction
Purpose: Build a k-nearest-neighbor graph of cells as input for clustering and visualization.
sc.pp.neighbors: Compute the kNN graph on the chosen low-dimensional representation (PCA or latent) with sc.pp.neighbors(adata, n_neighbors=15, n_pcs=30). This populates adata.obsp['connectivities'] and adata.obsp['distances']. The graph defines edges between similar cells. Parameters include n_neighbors, distance metric, and which embedding to use (via use_rep or default PCA).
Graph-based Refinements: Additional options allow customizing neighbor computation (e.g. method='umap' vs 'rapids-ann', etc.), but defaults suffice for most use cases. The neighbors graph underlies downstream UMAP/t-SNE and clustering. For example, sc.pp.neighbors(adata) is typically run before sc.tl.umap(adata)


## Clustering
Purpose: Identify groups of similar cells (e.g. cell types or states) in an unsupervised way.
Leiden Algorithm: A common approach is to use community detection on the kNN graph. Scanpy’s sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=1.0, key_added='leiden') partitions cells into clusters (stored in adata.obs['leiden']). Leiden is an improved version of Louvain and requires the neighbors graph to be precomputed. The resolution parameter controls cluster granularity (higher → more clusters).
Louvain Algorithm: Alternatively, use sc.tl.louvain(adata), which applies the Louvain method. It also depends on sc.pp.neighbors. Both algorithms label clusters in adata.obs.
Cluster Options: Both Leiden and Louvain can be run with different seeds or restrictions (e.g. restrict_to a subset of obs categories). One can also iterate clustering at multiple resolutions to explore structure.
Hierarchical Dendrogram (Optional): After clustering, Scanpy can build a dendrogram of cluster relationships with sc.tl.dendrogram(adata, groupby='leiden'), which stores a linkage in adata.uns and can be plotted with sc.pl.dendrogram. This helps interpret cluster similarities.
Result: The output is a categorical label per cell (e.g. adata.obs['leiden']) representing inferred clusters/cell groups. These are often interpreted as putative cell types or subpopulations.


## Trajectory and Pseudotime Analysis
Purpose: Model continuous developmental or differentiation processes.
Diffusion Pseudotime (DPT): Scanpy includes sc.tl.dpt(adata, n_dcs=10) to compute a diffusion-based pseudotemporal ordering. One must pick a “root” cell or cluster (often the presumed progenitor); DPT then assigns each cell a pseudotime (adata.obs['dpt_pseudotime']) based on diffusion distance from the root. This creates an ordering reflecting smooth transitions.
Partition-based Graph Abstraction (PAGA): PAGA computes a coarse-grained connectivity graph between clusters. Using sc.tl.paga(adata, groups='leiden'), one obtains adata.uns['paga'], where edges between clusters have confidence weights. Plotting sc.pl.paga(adata, threshold=0.03) shows a simplified graph of cluster relations. PAGA can also be used to initialize UMAP (sc.tl.umap(adata, init_pos='paga')) for embeddings faithful to overall topology


## Differential Expression and Marker Gene Detection
Purpose: Identify genes that are characteristic of clusters or conditions.
Rank Genes per Group: Use sc.tl.rank_genes_groups to perform marker analysis. Given adata.obs[groupby] (e.g. 'leiden'), this compares each group to others (or pairwise) and ranks genes by statistical tests. Methods include t-test, Welch’s t-test, Wilcoxon, or logistic regression (method='logreg'). For example, sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(adata, 'leiden', method='wilcoxon') fills adata.uns['rank_genes_groups'] with names, scores, p-values, and log-fold changes for top markers of each cluster. One can customize the test (e.g. method='logreg' for sparse markers). Results can be visualized with sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_heatmap or sc.pl.rank_genes_groups_dotplot.
Logistic Regression (Alternative): Setting method='logreg' performs logistic regression classification for each gene (as in Ntranos et al., 2019). It often yields robust marker sets.
SCVI Differential Expression: The trained SCVI model provides model.differential_expression, which can test for differentially expressed genes between groups of cells in a probabilistic framework. For example, model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="A", group2="B") returns a dataframe of DE statistics. SCVI supports 1-vs-1 or 1-vs-all testing. This method accounts for model uncertainty and can be more powerful in large datasets.


## Gene Signature Scoring
Purpose: Quantify the expression of gene sets (e.g. cell-cycle genes, pathways) per cell.
General Gene Set Scoring: sc.tl.score_genes(adata, gene_list, score_name="score") computes the average expression of a set of genes (minus average of random reference genes) for each cell. The result is added to adata.obs['score_name']. This can reflect pathway activity or other signatures.
Cell-Cycle Scoring: A specialized function sc.tl.score_genes_cell_cycle(adata, s_genes, g2m_genes) takes lists of S-phase and G2M-phase marker genes and assigns each cell an S_score, G2M_score, and a categorical phase (G1, S, or G2M). This is useful to regress out or analyze cell-cycle effects.
Options: Gene lists (e.g. provided with Scanpy, or user-defined) can be passed. The scoring considers control gene sets (by default) to normalize the scores. Cells are labeled by dominant phase if desired.

## Visualization
Purpose: Plot results (embeddings, marker expression, QC) to interpret data.
Embedding Plots: sc.pl.umap(adata, color=[...]) or sc.pl.tsne(...) plot the 2D embedding, coloring points by cluster, sample, or gene expression. For example, sc.pl.umap(adata, color=['leiden', 'n_genes_by_counts']). sc.pl.draw_graph (force layout) and sc.pl.paga (PAGA graph) are also available. Many sc.pl functions return Matplotlib axes if show=False.
QC and Metadata Plots: sc.pl.violin(adata, keys, ...) creates violin plots per group (e.g. distribution of counts or gene expression across clusters). In the QC tutorial, Scanpy shows violin plots of total counts and mitochondrial percentage. sc.pl.scatter(adata, x, y, color=...) makes 2D scatter (e.g. total_counts vs n_genes).
Marker Gene Plots: Once clusters are defined, visualizing marker genes is key. Common plots include dotplots, heatmaps, and violin plots of cluster markers. For example, sc.pl.dotplot(adata, var_names, groupby='leiden') shows mean expression (color) and percent expressed (dot size) of selected genes per cluster. Similarly, sc.pl.matrixplot is a heatmap variant. The core plotting tutorial demonstrates dotplots and violin plots for cluster markers.
Gene Expression Distributions: sc.pl.violin(adata, gene_list, groupby='leiden') and sc.pl.stacked_violin show the distribution of one or more genes across clusters.
Clustered Heatmaps: sc.pl.heatmap can display expression of marker genes across clusters. sc.pl.clustermap (wrapper around Seaborn) can cluster cells/genes in a heatmap, often using raw or log counts.
Pathway/Gene Set Plots: Custom heatmaps or barplots using Matplotlib/Seaborn can be made from gene scores or DE results (using Pandas/NumPy to extract data). Scanpy’s plots cover most scRNA needs, but any Matplotlib/Seaborn function can be used on data from adata.obs, adata.var, or adata.layers. For example, one might use sns.clustermap on a subset of adata.X.

RESPONSE/OUTPUT: revised_analysis

Revised Hypothesis: Epithelial cells in lung adenocarcinoma exhibit distinct functional states that correlate with smoking history, disease stage, and Treg abundance in the tumor microenvironment.

Revised Analysis Plan:
1. Subset the anndata object to focus on epithelial cells only
2. Perform higher-resolution clustering of epithelial cells to identify novel subpopulations with dynamic resolution
3. Identify marker genes for each epithelial subpopulation and functionally annotate them
4. Compare epithelial subpopulation proportions across smoking status categories using chi-square tests
5. Calculate Spearman correlations between epithelial subpopulation abundances and disease stage/treatment status
6. Use linear mixed models to compute the association between epithelial state abundances and Treg fractions across samples, accounting for patient-level covariates
7. Visualize epithelial state-specific gene expression gradients along disease progression axes using PAGA trajectory analysis
